1. You are given a dataset on movie reviews with a 1,000 labeled reviews. The labels are one of five movie genres: Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, and Sci-Fi. The dataset has roughly 200 movie reviews for each movie genre.
Your first task is to learn a supervised classifier to identify just the reviews for Comedy movies from the dataset. Such a task is:
> Two-class (Binary) classification

2. The dataset available for the first task is:
> Skewed

3. Suppose you decide to train a support vector machine classifier for this first task. The methodology you will employ will be a:
X One vs Rest classifier
> Single binary classifier

4. You are given a dataset on movie reviews with a 1,000 labeled reviews. The labels are one of five movie genres: Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, and Sci-Fi. The dataset has roughly 200 movie reviews for each movie genre.
Your second task is to learn to identify all five movie genres. Such a task is:
> Multi-class classification

5. The dataset available for the second task is:
> Balanced

6. Suppose you decide to train a support vector machine classifier for the second task. The methodology you will employ will be a:
> Either A or B

7. How many binary classifiers will you need to train for the second task using the one-vs-one classification approach?
X 10
> 5
