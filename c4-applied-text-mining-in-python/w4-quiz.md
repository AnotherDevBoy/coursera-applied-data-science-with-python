If the shortest distance between words A and B in the WordNet hierarchy is 6, the path-based similarity measure PathSim(A,B) would be:
X 1/6 = 0.167
> 1/(6+1) = 1/7 = 0.143

When computing the similarity between words C and D, the distributional similarity based metric gives a higher score than a path-based similarity measure. What can be inferred from this observation?
> Nothing can be inferred. The similarity values from different measures cannot be directly compared.
