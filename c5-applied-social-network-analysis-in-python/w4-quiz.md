1. Suppose P(k) denotes the degree distribution of the following network, what is the value of P(2) + P(3)?
> 1/2

2. Let P(k) denote the in-degree distribution of the given network below. What value of k gives the highest value of P(k)?
> 1

3. Select all that apply
> If we draw a power law distribution in log-log scale, the distribution will look like a straight line.
> The Preferential Attachment Model generates a network with a power law degree distribution.

4. Select all that apply
> Some Small-world networks have high local clustering coefficient and small average shortest path.
> In the small-world model starting with k nearest neighbors, increasing the rewiring probability p generally decreases both the average clustering coefficient and average shortest path.

5. Suppose we want to generate several small-world networks with k nearest neighbors and rewiring probability p. If p remains the same and we increase k, which best describes the variation of average local clustering coefficient and average shortest path?
> Average local clustering coefficient will increase and average shortest path will decrease.

6. Based on the network below, suppose we want to apply the common neighbors measure to add an edge from node H, which is the most probable node to connect to H?
> A

> 10

10. Assume there are two communities in this network: {A, B, C, D, G} and {E, F, H}. Which of the following statements is(are) True? Select all that apply.
