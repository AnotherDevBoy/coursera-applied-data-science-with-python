1. Based on the network below, what is the degree centrality of node D?
> 4 friends neighbours / 7 nodes - 1 = 0.67

2. Based on the network below, what is the closeness centrality of node G?
> 0.6

3. Based on the network below, what is the normalized betweenness centrality (excluding endpoints) of node G?
> 0.33

4.Select all True statements.
> 6

5. Select all True statements.
> We can use subsets of node-pairs to approximate betweenness centrality.
> The assumption of degree centrality is that important nodes have more connections.
> The closeness centrality of a node describes how far the node is from others.

6. Select all True statements about Page Rank (PR) and HITS in directed networks.
> The authority and hub score of each node is obtained by computing multiple iterations of HITS algorithm and both scores of most networks are convergent.
> Adding in-links of a node will never decrease its PR.

7. Given the network below, which value of alpha (damping parameter) listed below in the NetworkX function pagerank maximizes the PageRank of node D?
> 0.95

8. Based on the network below, what is the basic PR of node C at step k = 1?
> 0.625

9. Based on the network below, what are the corresponding normalized authority and hub scores of node C correspondingly after two iterations of HITS algorithm?
> 0.57, 0.09

10. Based on the network below, which of the following is NOT True? Check all that apply.
> Node Dâ€™s authority and hub score after k iterations (k>=1) are always 0.
