1. Consider the given network. What is the value of node F’s local clustering coefficient?
> Friends of F = 5
> Pair of friends of F = 5*4/2 = 10
> Pair of friends that are friends: A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, B-C, C-D, D-E
> Local Clustering Coefficient = 7/10 = 0.7

2. Given the following two networks, which of the following is True?
> Network (A) has higher average local clustering coefficient but lower transitivity than (B).  

3. Consider the network shown below and select all that apply.
> The radius of this network is half of its diameter.
> The deletion of node G will make the network disconnected.
> If we perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) from node A, the BFS tree we obtain will have a depth of 4.
> The eccentricity of node B and C are equal.

4. Select all that apply for the network below.
> It is a disconnected graph with 2 connected components.
> If edge (E,G) is removed, the number of connected components will not change.
> We can make the graph connected by adding edge (E,J).

5. Consider three networks (A), (B) and (C) below and select all that apply.
> Only network (B) is a strongly connected graph.
> We only need to add one directed edge in order to change network (C) to a strongly connected graph.

6 Which of the following is true about network robustness and connectivity? Select all that apply.
> The closure of an airport and the cancellation of a flight route are examples of two different kinds of network attacks in the real world.
> Network robustness measures a network’s ability to maintain its connectivity.
> Adding edges to a network can never make the network less robust.

7. Consider the network given below.
> 1 (node E)

8. Consider the network given below.
> 2 (E-G, E-H)

9. The directed network below shows how information can be transferred between nodes. For example, node A can pass the information to node C directly but not vice-versa. If node C wants to send messages to node A, all data must be forwarded by node B.
> 8

10. The directed network below shows how information can be transferred between nodes. For example, node A can pass the information to node C directly but not vice-versa. If node C wants to send messages to node A, all data must be forwarded by node B.
> Removing node F and H
> Removing edges (H,K) and (E,F)
